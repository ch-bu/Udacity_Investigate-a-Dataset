# Titanic Survival Exploration

This [project](https://github.com/udacity/Project-Descriptions-for-Review/blob/master/Machine-Learning/Titanic%20Survival%20Exploration.md) is part of the [Nanodegree on Machine Learning of Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009). It is an optional started project. 

In this project I created a decision function that predicts the survival of passengers in the 1912 Titanic disaster at an accuracy of above 80%.
